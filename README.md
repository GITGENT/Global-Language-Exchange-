Project Overview
################

What it is:
  This project is a Global Language Exchange App designed to connect language learners and native speakers worldwide. The platform enables users to practice new languages through real-time chat, video calls, and       community-driven resources.

Why it exists:
  Learning a language can be challenging without access to native speakers or cultural immersion. This app bridges that gap by providing a global platform for connecting people based on their target languages, proficiency levels, and learning preferences.

Who itâ€™s for:
  This app is ideal for:

  Language Learners: Individuals wanting to practice or improve their skills with native speakers.
  Teachers and Tutors: Educators looking for a platform to connect with students for language lessons.
  Cultural Enthusiasts: People interested in learning about other cultures while helping others learn their native language.
